        The agent has a fixed size vocabulary that it learns from files selected randomly from
        the directories specified by inspiring set. The agent plays motifs by selecting them from its vocabulary
        and making variations of them. The agent can also learn new motifs from the environment.

        The agent evaluates its own performance using the variable confidence which is the average of all evaluations
        the agent has made of its own playing. The agents play motifs only if they think that it would improve their
        confidence level.
